# Code Scratchpad

This repo is a basic way to prototype or start a project quickly.

To use this project you must have [Node Package Manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed.

It uses [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) as an app bundler with use of [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) with [Nesting](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-nesting) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to make building styles easy. It also employs [ES6+ JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript) for a modern and flexible approach to interactivity and application development.

## To get started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Run Snowpack:

```sh
npm run start
```

The project will open in the browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

You will know everything works because it will load a pink page with red centered text as well as some basic logs in the console that show the text on the page.
